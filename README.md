Suffix Tree - Ukkonen algorithm
============================
This project includes an implementation of the Ukkonen algorithm written in C++. The main.cpp reads a file input from 'inputString.txt' located in the directory of the binary file, creates a suffix tree using the Ukkonen algorithm and presents the output in .dot notation so the tree can be displayed using any graphviz library.

The tree.dot file can be displayed with the ukkonenGraph.py script located in the same folder as the tree.dot output file. It uses the pydot library: [Pydot](https://code.google.com/p/pydot/) and matplotlib: [matplot](http://matplotlib.org/)

The project is an assignment for Bioinformatics class on the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)
